Hello! I'm Oliver (he/him) and I'm currently a senior Computer Science major at Western Colorado University!

I'm very interested in developing games and currently am planning out a project for my Programming in Rust course to create a simple 2D game in rust. 
I'm open to any ideas and invite you to watch my pogress!
I also have an interest in developing moblie application and am currently in the process of making two. An AR ski app and a DnD charater creator/manager. 
I also own a cat named Reef who loves to help me with all of my projects by standing on my keyboard. 

Send me a message to my LinkedIn or email if you want to chat!
